## How It Works Behind the Scenes:

1. **When someone joins your channel:** They get their referral link automatically (or when they start the bot)

2. **When they share their link:** New members join via their unique referral link

3. **Progress tracking:** The bot tracks all referrals and rewards automatically

4. **Rewards:** Users can claim rewards after 10 successful referrals

## Current User Flow:

### Option 1 (Recommended):
1. User starts the bot first: @[YourBotUsername]
2. User joins your channel (manually or via invite)
3. Bot immediately sends them their referral link

### Option 2 (Automatic):
1. User joins your channel directly
2. User starts the bot later: @[YourBotUsername]  
3. Bot sends them their stored referral link

## Tips for Maximum Engagement:

1. **Pin the instructions** in your channel
2. **Post regular reminders** about the referral system
3. **Share success stories** of members who earned rewards
4. **Create urgency** with limited-time bonus rewards
5. **Engage with top referrers** to encourage others
